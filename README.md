Description: The program will 1) Design and implement new ReadVal (input) and WriteVal (output) procedures 
for signed integers. 2) Design and implement macros getString and displayString to facilitate new I/O procedures. 
The procedures and macros will convert string values to numeric values and numeric values back to string. 3) Write 
a small test program that gets 10 valid integers from the user and stores the numeric values in an array. The 
program then displays the integers, their sum, and their average. Integer array is displayed in numeric form, 
sum and average are displayed in string form.
